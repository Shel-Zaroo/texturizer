Status - Incomplete

This is an application to add text based features to a dataset.

It will accept a CSV, TSV or XLS file and output an extended version of
the dataset with additional columns appended. When run with default settings
it will produce very simple and rapid numerical summaries. Additional feature
flags unlock deeper NLP based features that are more computationally intensive.

Released and distributed via setuptools/PyPI/pip for Python 3.

Built using the
[bootstrap cmdline template](https://github.com/jgehrcke/python-cmdline-bootstrap)

### TODO

### Resources

I will be using a combination of [spacy](https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101) and NLTK
